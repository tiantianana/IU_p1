                <h4>Bahamas</h4>
                <p>With more than 700 islands and cays, the Bahamas are best explored by boat. If you have sailing
                    experience, Great Abaco is one of the most rewarding places to charter a yacht. The nearby Treasure,
                    Green Turtle, Man-O-War and Elbow Cays are dotted with sheltered anchorages and people-free beaches.

                <h4>Canada</h4>
                <p>Canada is one of the world’s most desirable tourist destinations. The second largest country on
                    earth, Canada is blessed with abundant natural resources and wildlife, four distinct seasons,
                    dynamic cities, culinary delights, pristine wilderness regions, and more outdoor adventures than you
                    can shake a paddle at. Here are some ideas for sightseeing, places to visit in Canada and more.

                <h4>China</h4>
                <p>Thrill to a culture-stuffed vacation in an insanely diverse country that’s developing at breakneck
                    speed. China is a place where sprawling suburbs extend ever outward and cutting-edge skyscrapers are
                    continually popping up. Despite the souped-up pace of modernity, ancient traditions and buildings
                    are ever-present and perfect for exploring.

                <h4>Costa Rica</h4>
                <p>Situated between Panama and Nicaragua, the tiny Central American country of Costa Rica is unlike any
                    other, with a peaceful history and a booming tourism business. Breath-taking rainforests, booming
                    volcanoes, some of the most rare and endangered wildlife on the planet, adventure, relaxation and
                    fun abound. </p>

            <div class="grid-item"><img src="images/egypt.jpg"/>
                <h4>Egypt</h4>
                <p>Egypt is not only a country of antiquity, but also of magnificent landscapes offering cities and
                    oases, deserts and beaches, ancient obelisks and modern hotels. Bordered by the Mediterranean, the
                    Red Sea and the fabled Nile River, you can experience eras as far back as the dawn of civilization.
                    But Egypt is much more than Pyramids and monuments.

                <h4>Norway</h4>
                <p>Thanks to the variety of landscapes, natural phenomena, activities and ways to get around, Norway
                    makes a fantastic destination year-round. In summer, the extended daylight of the midnight sun is
                    perfect for sightseeing and road trips; while in winter the long nights create ideal conditions for
                    viewing the northern lights, perhaps while dog-sledding or snowmobiling.

            <div class="grid-item"><img src="images/spain.jpg"/>
                <h4>Spain</h4>
                <p>Spain is made up of some of the most popular beach holiday destinations in Europe those found on the
                    Costa Del Sol, Tenerife, the Balearic Islands, the Costa Blanca, and Barcelona.
                    Spain's gastronomy is second and is well known its black foot cured ham, paella, olives, seafood,
                    fish, garlic, as well as great wines such as Rioja and Sherry.

            <div class="grid-item"><img src="images/tanzania.jpg"/>
                <h4>Tanzania</h4>
                <p>A visit to Tanzania can mean one of many things – it might be a city escape in Dar Es Salaam, a beach
                    getaway in Zanzibar, a safari in Serengeti, a trek to the peak of Mt. Kilimanjaro or a combination
                    of all of the above! The seasons certainly play a detrimental role to what kind of experience will
                    be had and when, so be sure to read ahead in advance to ensure you have the kind of trip you’re
                    intending for!
